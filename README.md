# serviceVisits

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This package will be intended as a sleek, easier-to-use alternative to R pipes (both native and Magrittr). We aim for them to make coding easier, and also make code easier to understand by others.

Why the name serviceVisits? Think of a pipe as analogous to an automobile assembly line. The car moves through various stages of production, just as data might do in traversing a pipe. But here the data will "stay in one place," with "visits" by various "services."

The approach relies heavily on global objects (these are what "don't move"). This is rather counter to R philosophy--though base-R graphics essentially follow the same pattern--and thus not for everyone, but some should find it quite useful.
